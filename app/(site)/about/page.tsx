          BeaconPulse is a playform that allows you to be able to mint our
          signature Pulsewave NFT erc-721 token. That allows you to be able to
          use for, as profile picture, trade with your friends, or even use it
          to earn rewards.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are a community looking to allow people to safely get a token which
          they will be able to later use for trading, purchasing, or earn
          interst on. As well as be able to let them know the difference between
          a native token and a alt coin.
        </p>
        <p>
          We welcome anyone with comments and questions to our social channels
          to communicate with us, or use the form to be able to contact via
          email.
        </p>
        <p>
          What makes us unique is that we are going to be implementing a way for users to be able to use their token with buisness who accept it.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are going to be working on the ethereum network and slowly transition to a more open operable network where we will then be able to allow other networks to connect and mint our token and if there are any nfts left mint they will mint but if all is out they will be able to find it on marketplaces like openesea or other places that allow you to trade or sell your nft..
